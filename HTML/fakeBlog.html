    <p style="padding-left: 20px; text-indent: 30px;"><b><i>Coffee</i></b> is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. When coffee berries turn from green to bright red in color – indicating ripeness – they are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as "beans") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as coffee.</p>

    <h3>Health Benefits</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Coffee may help you lose weight</b></li>
      <li><b>You are less likely to develop Parkinson's disease</b></li>
      <li><b>You're less likely to develop heart failure</b></li>
      <li><b>Coffee reduces risk of cancers</b></li>
      <li><b>Your body may process glucose (or sugar) better</b></li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Coffee may help you lose weight</h4>
    <p>Coffee contains magnesium and potassium, which helps the human body use insulin, regulating blood sugar levels and reducing your craving for sugary treats and snacks.</p>
    <h4>You are less likely to develop Parkinson's disease</h4>
    <p>Caffeine is not only linked to a lower chance of developing Parkinson’s disease, but it may also help those with the condition better control their movements.</p>
    <h4>You're less likely to develop heart failure</h4>
    <p>Drinking one to two cups of coffee a day may help ward off heart failure, when a weakened heart has difficulty pumping enough blood to the body.</p>
    <h4>Coffee reduces risk of cancers</h4>
    <p>One study has shown that coffee may decrease the risk of developing prostate cancer in men by 20 %, and endometrial cancer in women by 25 %. People in the test group drank four cups of coffee a day. Caffeine may also prevent developing of basal cell carcinoma, the most common type of skin cancer</p>
    <h4>Your body may process glucose (or sugar) better</h4>
    <p>That’s the theory behind studies that found that people who drink more coffee are less likely to get type 2 diabetes.</p>

          <td>
            <p>You can make this type of coffee quite simply by adding hot water to a shot of espresso coffee. It has been said that American soldiers during WWII made this type of coffee to make their beverages last longer. It was then (apparently) adopted by American baristas after the war.</p>

          <td>Café Latte</td>
          <td>
            <p>A fairly popular option for coffee drinkers, a latte consists steamed (or scalded) milk and a single shot of coffee. It is usually quite frothy, and you’ll occasionally encounter cafes that don’t understand the difference between this and a flat white.</p>

          <td>Cappuccino</td>
          <td>
            <p>Possibly the most popular type of coffee in the world, a cappuccino consists of three layers (kind of like a cake). The first is a shot of espresso, then a shot of steamed milk, and finally the barista adds a layer of frothed, foamy milk. This final layer can also be topped with chocolate shavings or powder. Traditionally, Italians consumed this type of coffee at breakfast.</p>

        <tr>
          <td>Espresso</td>
          <td>
            <p>To make an espresso, shoot boiling water under high pressure through finely ground coffee beans and then pour into a tiny mug. Sounds simple right? Well, it’s surprisingly difficult to master. Espressos are the purest coffee experience you can get, and while they’re not for everyone, it can be a truly singular drinking experience when you find a good brew.</p>

        <tr>
          <td>Macchiato</td>
          <td>
            <p>A macchiato is a shot of espresso that is then topped off with foamed milk dashed directly into the cup.  Although it may sound similar to a cappuccino, it’s usually stronger as there’s no steamed milk added and it’s also smaller, usually served in an espresso-sized cup.</p>
